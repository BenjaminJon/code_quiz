## This repo contains source files for Ben Buckley's code challenge.

## NOTES
I assume you have a working C++ environment with make installed.  I used macOS with XCode cli tools.
It should work by default on Linux.

Running it in it's current state will show some test cases I coded while writing and testing the code.

## After cloning, build and run:
`make; ./bjbCodeTest;`
